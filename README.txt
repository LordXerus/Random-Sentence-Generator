How to build the code:
----------------------
There is no building or compiling required since the files are javascript, html, and css.



How to run the code:
--------------------
Unzip the zipped .tzg file, and open file:///C:/.../index.html in your web browser.



How to use the code:
--------------------
- Select the markov order from the dropdown (a higher markov order produces sentences that are increasingly grammatically correct)
- Specify the number of characters that should be generated by the random sentence generator
- Paste starter text into the large text field. The more text pasted here, the better quality the sentences that are produced.
  A starter text file is included that can be used to paste as the starter text for the sentence generator (it is a very large text file - copying and pasting a few dozen lines would be sufficient, but the more that is pasted in, the more interesting and cohesive the output of the random generator becomes)
- Click the "Generate Sentences" button and view the resulting generated sentences
